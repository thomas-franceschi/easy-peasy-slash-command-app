#Tic-Tac-Toe

The game operates using the /ttt slash command. A game is initiated using 
the @username of the team member you want to challenge. From there you take 
turns choosing squares to mark. Each square is numbered from 1-9 with 1 being 
the top left corner and 9 being the bottom right. The game is won when a player
gets three in a row or the quit command is invoked. At that point all variables 
are reset so another game can be initiated.

A game is initiated with the /ttt @opponent command
A move is made with a /ttt # command where # is a digit from 1-9
The current board can be displayed with the /ttt show board command.
The game can be quit using the /ttt quit command.
